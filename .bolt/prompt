🍞 BakeStatements – Master Knowledge & PRD
Purpose & Ethos

BakeStatements is the financial co-pilot for home bakers and micro bakeries in Australia. Our mission is to simplify bookkeeping, compliance, and branding so bakers can spend less time worrying about paperwork and more time creating.

We believe:

Bakers deserve tools as sweet and simple as their creations.

Compliance (ATO, invoices, ABN, labels) shouldn’t feel like a burden.

Modern branding should be accessible, professional, and delightful even for small home-based businesses.

Our mascot — the friendly koala with a whisk and calculator — symbolizes warmth, trust, and balance between creativity and numbers.

Branding & UX Notes

Mascot: always the Koala (hero image, favicons, playful touches).

Typography: round, approachable sans-serif (similar to Nunito / Baloo).

Colors: pastel pinks, creamy whites, cocoa accents.

Voice: friendly, professional, and empowering — never corporate.

Accessibility: mobile-first, clear contrast, alt text for all graphics.

Roadmap Philosophy

Stage 1 → Ship fast, prove value.

Stage 2 → Add branding/label features to differentiate from BakeGenie.

Stage 3 → Expand into full bakery management (orders, inventory, compliance).

🔑 Instruction to Bolt / Lovable:
Always prioritize:

A friendly koala hero image in the header.

Expense & invoice tools front-and-center.

Simple UX that feels like a baker’s notebook, not corporate accounting.
